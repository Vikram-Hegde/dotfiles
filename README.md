# dotfiles

- Configuration files for Neovim and Fish shell
- Boilerplate for Web Development
- Script for creating the boilerplate

All of these config files are stored in Home directory so I setup a Git Bare Repository to upload all of these to Github therefore keeping a backup making it easy to port the same config to other machines

## Todo

  -[  ] Port all plugins to lua

  -[  ] Modularize config files
